# go
cute custom import names for my Go stuff

I was gonna put [this](https://github.com/bobheadxi/go) here.

Would be cool to auto generate the gh-pages branch using GitHub Actions.

I think it would be cool to also integrate [gopkg.in](https://gopkg.in) versioning support. But then I can't use [Twist](https://github.com/bobheadxi/twist).

all a project for another time.
